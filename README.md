# Horiseon Social Solution Services Webpage

## Description

This project is a homepage for Horiseon, a marketing agency specializing in SEO and online reputation management. 
The motivation behind this project was to shoot Horiseon's webpage to the top of the relative search engine results.
This was achieved through adding accessibility best-practices such as alt attributes in img tags, and meta data to 
broaden their compatibility.  The end-result is a webpage that adheres to accessibility standards and is optimized for 
search engines.  In the making of this project, I learned about cutting down on redundant CSS and HTML, how to write a professional README, and best-practice standards for various elements in HTML and CSS. 
Provide a short description explaining the what, why, and how of your project. Use the following questions as a guide:
